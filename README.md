# Computational-Chemistry

- Created Harmonic Oscillator Eigen states with analytical approach using Hermite Polynomial function in python.

- Compare the behaviour of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator to a Classical Harmonic Oscillator as the quantum number is increased.

- Used celluloid to create an animation of the plot of the potential energy function and energy levels using matplotlib.
